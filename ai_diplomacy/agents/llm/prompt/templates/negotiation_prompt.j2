Game Context and Relevant Information (e.g., messages from previous phases, current board state):
{{ context_text }}
{% if tools_available %}

If you need to access external information or perform complex calculations to formulate your messages, you can use the available tools. To use a tool, output a JSON object with a 'tool_name' and 'tool_input' field. Wait for the tool's response before proceeding with your messages. If you do not need a tool, provide your messages directly.{% endif %}

Based on all the information above, your strategic goals, and your relationships, decide on any diplomatic messages you want to send to other powers.
Return your response as a JSON object with a single key "messages".
The value of "messages" should be a list of JSON objects, where each object represents a message and has the following structure:
{
  "recipient": "COUNTRY_NAME",  // The country you are sending the message to
  "content": "Your message text here...", // The actual message content
  "message_type": "PROPOSAL" // Type of message (e.g., PROPOSAL, INFO, WARNING, QUESTION, RESPONSE, CHAT)
}
For example:
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "recipient": "FRANCE",
      "content": "Shall we form an alliance against Germany?",
      "message_type": "PROPOSAL"
    },
    {
      "recipient": "GERMANY",
      "content": "I noticed your army in Burgundy. I have no aggressive intentions towards you at this time.",
      "message_type": "INFO"
    }
  ]
}
If you do not want to send any messages this phase, return an empty list: {"messages": []}.
Do not add any commentary or explanation outside of the JSON structure.
Ensure your messages are strategically sound and contribute to your goals.
