## 1. Module Status

### COMPLETED MODULES:

#### 1.1. `game_history.py` (COMPLETE)
**Goal:** To structure, store, and retrieve the historical events of a Diplomacy game phase by phase, including messages, plans, orders, and results.
**Status:** Fully implemented and operational.

*Key Components:*
* `DiplomacyGraph`: Represents map territory connectivity with support for unit-specific movement rules (Army vs Fleet).
* `bfs_shortest_path`: Finds shortest path from a starting territory to any territory matching criteria.
* `bfs_nearest_adjacent`: Finds shortest path to a territory adjacent to any territory in a target set.
* `build_diplomacy_graph`: Constructs the graph representation from the game map.

#### 1.2. Core Game Management Modules (NEW - Refactored from `lm_game.py`)
These modules were created by refactoring core logic out of `lm_game.py` to improve modularity and maintainability.

*   `game_config.py`: Manages game configuration parameters derived from arguments and provides centralized access to paths and settings.
*   `logging_setup.py`: Centralizes application-wide logging configuration, including console and file handlers.
*   `agent_manager.py`: Handles the lifecycle (creation, model assignment, initialization, storage) of `DiplomacyAgent` instances.
*   `game_orchestrator.py`: Orchestrates the main game loop, phase transitions, agent actions (planning, negotiation, orders), and game state progression.
*   `game_results.py`: Manages the processing and saving of final game data, including game state, history, and agent manifestos.
*   `phase_summary.py`: (Refactored) Provides tools for generating detailed game phase summaries (e.g., `PhaseSummaryGenerator` used by the orchestrator).

#### 1.3. `phase_summary.py` (COMPLETE, in lm_game.py)
**Goal:** Generate concise, structured summaries of each game phase for post-game analysis.
**Status:** Fully implemented via `phase_summary_callback` in `lm_game.py`. (Note: This entry describes the *original* state. The module has been refactored as listed above).

**Key Components:**
* Structured summaries with:
  * Current board state (sorted by supply center count)
  * Successful moves by power
  * Unsuccessful moves by power with failure reasons
  * Optional sections for other move types

#### 1.4. `agent.py` (COMPLETE WITH ENHANCED MEMORY SYSTEM)
**Goal:** To maintain stateful agent representation with personality, goals, relationships, and sophisticated memory management.
**Status:** Fully implemented with dual memory system (journal + diary) and yearly consolidation.

**Key Components:**
* `DiplomacyAgent` class with:
  * `power_name`: The power this agent represents
  * `goals`: List of strategic goals, dynamically updated each phase
  * `relationships`: Dict tracking relationships (Enemy/Unfriendly/Neutral/Friendly/Ally) with other powers
  * `private_journal`: Unstructured internal logs for debugging/events
  * `private_diary`: Structured, phase-prefixed strategic summaries - THE MAIN MEMORY SYSTEM
  * `client`: BaseModelClient instance for LLM interactions
  * Power-specific system prompts loaded from `prompts/{power_name}_system_prompt.txt`

**Memory System Architecture:**
1. **Private Journal** (Less Important):
   * Simple string entries via `add_journal_entry()`
   * Used for: "Goals updated", "Relationship changed", "Message sent", etc.
   * Not directly fed to LLMs
   * More like internal debug logs

2. **Private Diary** (Critical for Decision Making):
   * Structured entries with phase prefix via `add_diary_entry(entry, phase)`
   * Three types of diary entries generated each phase:
     - **Negotiation Diary** (`generate_negotiation_diary_entry`): Analyzes messages, updates relationships
     - **Order Diary** (`generate_order_diary_entry`): Records strategic reasoning behind orders
     - **Phase Result Diary** (`generate_phase_result_diary_entry`): Analyzes outcomes, detects betrayals
   * Fed to LLMs via `format_private_diary_for_prompt(max_entries=40)`
   * **Yearly Consolidation** (`consolidate_year_diary_entries`):
     - Triggered 2 years after a given year (e.g., in S1903M, consolidate 1901)
     - Uses Gemini Flash to summarize all entries from a year into one concise entry
     - Replaces individual entries with `[CONSOLIDATED 1901] summary...`
     - Prevents context bloat while preserving key memories

**Advanced JSON Parsing:**
* `_extract_json_from_text`: Multi-strategy parser handling various LLM output formats
  * Handles ```json blocks, {{...}} blocks, PARSABLE OUTPUT: formats
  * Uses json5 and json_repair as fallbacks
  * Aggressive cleaning for common LLM formatting issues
  * Returns empty dict on failure rather than crashing

**State Update System:**
* `analyze_phase_and_update_state`: Async method that:
  * Uses phase summaries and board state
  * Updates goals based on game evolution
  * Adjusts relationships based on actions (not just words)
  * Validates all updates with allowed values
  * Has robust error handling with fallback to current state

**Integration Points:**
* Diary provides historical context for all LLM calls
* Relationships influence negotiation tone and alliance decisions
* Goals drive strategic planning and order generation
* Power-specific prompts shape agent personality
* All LLM interactions logged via `utils.log_llm_response`

#### 1.5. `negotiations.py` (COMPLETE)
**Goal:** To orchestrate the communication phase among active AI powers.
**Status:** Fully implemented and integrated with DiplomacyAgent state.
**Note:** Relies heavily on `prompts/conversation_instructions.txt` to guide LLMs in generating correctly formatted messages for parsing.

#### 1.6. `planning.py` (COMPLETE)
**Goal:** To allow each AI power to generate a high-level strategic directive or plan.
**Status:** Fully implemented and integrated with DiplomacyAgent state.

#### 1.7. `utils.py` (COMPLETE)
**Goal:** To provide common utility functions used across other AI diplomacy modules.
**Status:** Fully implemented.

#### 1.8. `clients.py` (COMPLETE)
**Goal:** To abstract and manage interactions with various LLM APIs.
**Status:** Fully implemented with agent state integration (including personality, goals, relationships, and the new `private_diary` for summarized history). It now also leverages `possible_order_context.py` for richer order details in prompts.
**Note:** Uses various files in `prompts/` (e.g., `context_prompt.txt`, `order_instructions.txt`, `negotiation_diary_prompt.txt`, `order_diary_prompt.txt`) to structure LLM requests. `context_prompt.txt` has been updated to use `agent_private_diary` for history and a more structured `{possible_orders}` section generated by `possible_order_context.generate_rich_order_context`.

#### 1.9. `initialization.py` (NEWLY ADDED & COMPLETE)
**Goal:** To perform the initial LLM-driven setup of an agent's goals and relationships at the very start of the game (Spring 1901).
**Status:** Fully implemented and integrated into `lm_game.py`.

**Key Components:**
* `initialize_agent_state_ext(agent: DiplomacyAgent, game: Game, game_history: GameHistory, log_file_path: str)`: An asynchronous function that:
    *   Constructs a specific prompt tailored for Spring 1901, asking for initial goals and relationships.
    *   Utilizes the agent's client (`agent.client`) and the `run_llm_and_log` utility for the LLM interaction.
    *   Parses the JSON response using the agent's `_extract_json_from_text` method.
    *   Directly updates the `agent.goals` and `agent.relationships` attributes with the LLM's suggestions or defaults if parsing fails.

**Integration Points:**
*   Called once per agent from `lm_game.py` immediately after the `DiplomacyAgent` object is instantiated and before the main game loop begins.

#### 1.10. `possible_order_context.py` (COMPLETE)
**Goal:** To generate rich, strategic context about possible orders including pathfinding and territory analysis.
**Status:** Fully implemented and integrated into order generation prompts.

**Key Components:**
* `build_diplomacy_graph`: Creates adjacency graph with unit-specific movement rules
* `bfs_shortest_path`: Finds shortest paths considering unit movement restrictions
* `get_nearest_enemy_units`: Identifies closest threats using BFS
* `get_nearest_uncontrolled_scs`: Finds expansion opportunities
* `get_adjacent_territory_details`: Analyzes neighboring territories and support possibilities
* `generate_rich_order_context`: Main function creating structured XML context for each orderable unit

**Integration:**
* Called by `prompt_constructor.py` to enhance order generation prompts
* Provides strategic insights like "nearest enemy 3 moves away" or "undefended SC 2 territories north"

#### 1.11. `prompt_constructor.py` (COMPLETE)
**Goal:** To centralize and standardize prompt construction for all LLM interactions.
**Status:** Fully implemented, replacing scattered prompt building logic.

**Key Functions:**
* `build_context_prompt`: Creates comprehensive game context including:
  * Board state, unit positions, supply centers
  * Power-specific goals and relationships
  * Recent game history from agent's diary
  * Strategic analysis from `possible_order_context`
* `construct_order_generation_prompt`: Specialized for order generation with:
  * Full context from `build_context_prompt`
  * Detailed possible orders with strategic annotations
  * Order validation rules and format requirements

#### 1.12. `narrative.py` (PLACEHOLDER/FUTURE)
**Goal:** To generate narrative descriptions of game events for visualization/entertainment.
**Status:** Referenced in imports but not yet implemented.
**Potential Features:**
* Convert dry game events into dramatic narratives
* Generate "news reports" of battles and diplomatic developments
* Create power-specific propaganda/spin on events

## 2. Integration Points

The following connections have been established:

1. **Initial Agent Setup (New)**:
   * `lm_game.py` calls `initialization.py`'s `initialize_agent_state_ext` for each agent. This function uses an LLM call to populate the agent's initial `goals` and `relationships` before the main game loop and other agent interactions commence.

2. **Agent State → Context Building**
   * `BaseModelClient.build_context_prompt` in `clients.py` incorporates the agent's current `goals`, `relationships`, and the concise `agent_private_diary` for historical context.
   * It also calls `possible_order_context.generate_rich_order_context` to provide a detailed and strategically relevant breakdown of possible orders, replacing a simpler list.
   * `prompts/context_prompt.txt` is formatted to accept these inputs, including the structured possible orders and the agent's private diary.

3. **Agent State → Negotiations**
   * Agent's personality, goals, and relationships influence message generation
   * Relationships are updated based on negotiation context and results

4. **Robust LLM Interaction**
   * Implemented multi-strategy JSON extraction to handle various LLM response formats
   * Added case-insensitive validation for power names and relationship statuses
   * Created fallback mechanisms for all LLM interactions

5. **Error Recovery**
   * Added defensive programming throughout agent state updates
   * Implemented progressive fallback strategies for parsing LLM outputs
   * Used intelligent defaults to maintain consistent agent state

## 3. Main Game Loop Flow (`lm_game.py`)

The main game loop orchestrates all components in a sophisticated async flow:

1. **Initialization Phase**:
   * Create `DiplomacyAgent` instances for each power
   * Load power-specific system prompts
   * Run `initialize_agent_state_ext` concurrently for all agents
   * Set up logging infrastructure

2. **Per-Phase Flow** (Movement phases only for negotiations):
   * **Negotiations** (if enabled):
     - Round-robin message generation via `conduct_negotiations`
     - Async generation of messages considering relationships
     - Updates to `game_history` with all messages
   * **Planning** (if enabled):
     - Strategic directive generation via `planning_phase`
     - Considers current goals and game state
   * **Diary Generation** (Negotiation):
     - Each agent generates negotiation diary entry
     - Relationships may be updated based on messages
   * **Order Generation**:
     - Concurrent order generation for all powers
     - Rich context from `possible_order_context`
     - Validation and fallback logic
