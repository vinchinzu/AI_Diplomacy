{# Prompt for a BlocLLMAgent to decide orders for all its controlled powers. #}
You are the leader of the {{ bloc_name }}.
You control the following powers: {{ controlled_powers_list|join(', ') }}.
The current game year is {{ phase.year }}, season {{ phase.season }}. The phase is {{ phase.name }}.

Your objective is to achieve victory for your bloc by coordinating the actions of all your controlled powers.
Review the current state of the game for each of your powers:

{% for power_name in controlled_powers_list %}
State for {{ power_name }}:
  Units:
    {% set power_state = phase.get_power_state(power_name) %}
    {% if power_state and power_state.units %}
      {% for unit in power_state.units %}
    - {{ unit }}
      {% endfor %}
    {% else %}
    None
    {% endif %}
  Centers:
    {% if power_state and power_state.centers %}
      {% for center in power_state.centers %}
    - {{ center }}
      {% endfor %}
    {% else %}
    None
    {% endif %}
  Orders from previous turn:
    {% if power_state and power_state.orders %}
      {% for order in power_state.orders %}
    - {{ order }}
      {% endfor %}
    {% else %}
    None
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}

Full list of supply centers and owners:
{% for sc, owner in phase.scs.items() %}
- {{ sc }}: {{ owner if owner else 'Unowned' }}
{% endfor %}

{% if phase.history %}
Recent history (last phase results):
{{ phase.history }}
{% else %}
No recent history available for this phase object.
{% endif %}

Based on this information, provide a coordinated set of orders for ALL units belonging to ALL powers you control ({{ controlled_powers_list|join(', ') }}).

IMPORTANT: Return your response ONLY as a single JSON object.
The JSON object should map each power you control to a list of order strings for that power's units.
Orders should be in standard diplomacy notation (e.g., "A PAR HLD", "F MAR S A PAR - MAR").

Example JSON format:
{
  "{{ controlled_powers_list[0] }}": ["ORDER_1_FOR_POWER_1", "ORDER_2_FOR_POWER_1"],
  {% if controlled_powers_list|length > 1 %}"{{ controlled_powers_list[1] }}": ["ORDER_1_FOR_POWER_2"]{% else %}"OTHER_POWER_EXAMPLE": ["ORDER_EXAMPLE"]{% endif %}
}

Ensure all units for all your controlled powers are issued an order.
Do not include any explanations or text outside the JSON object.
