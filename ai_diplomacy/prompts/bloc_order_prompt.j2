Here are the only possible orders you can issue for your powers this turn:
{% for power, orders in possible_orders.items() %}
- {{ power }}: {{ orders | join(', ') }}
{% endfor %}

Based on this, provide orders for all powers in your bloc. Only choose orders from the list above. Respond in JSON format, with each key being a power name and the value being a list of orders.
Use "A" for Army and "F" for Fleet. Move orders use a hyphen (e.g., "A PAR - BUR"). Hold orders use "H" (e.g., "A MAR H").

  "ENGLAND": [
