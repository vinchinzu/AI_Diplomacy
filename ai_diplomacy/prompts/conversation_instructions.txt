You MUST generate negotiation message(s) to advance your strategic interests. Consider your current goals, relationships with other powers, and the ongoing conversation.

**Your Task:** Craft one or more negotiation messages. Format EACH message as a separate JSON object. Use messages strategically to propose alliances, issue warnings, gather information, work together, or mislead opponents, always keeping your long-term goals and current relationships in mind.

**Output Format:**
Respond ONLY with one or more JSON objects. Do NOT include any other text, commentary, or explanation outside the JSON structure.

Each JSON object MUST have the following keys:
- "message_type": Either "global" (to send to all powers) or "private" (to send to one power).
- "content": The text content of your message. Be persuasive, deceptive, or direct as required by your strategy.

If "message_type" is "private", you MUST also include:
- "recipient": The name of the target power (e.g., "FRANCE", "RUSSIA").

**Examples:**

Example 1: Sending a global message warning COUNTRY
{{
  "message_type": "global",
  "content": "COUNTRY's aggression in the south will not go unanswered."
}}

Example 2: Sending a private message proposing cooperation with COUNTRY
{{
  "message_type": "private",
  "recipient": "RUSSIA",
  "content": "Perhaps we can coordinate against our mutual COUNTRY problem?"
}}

Example 3: Sending multiple messages (a global statement and a private proposal)
{{
  "message_type": "global",
  "content": "Let's focus on maintaining stability this turn."
}}
{{
  "message_type": "private",
  "recipient": "GERMANY",
  "content": "Secretly, I'm planning to move against COUNTRY. Can you support?"
}}

**Important:**
- Adhere strictly to the JSON format. Every response MUST contain at least one valid JSON message block.
- Ensure recipient names are spelled correctly if sending private messages.
- Think strategically about *why* you are sending each message and what outcome you hope to achieve.
