PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F PIC - ENG' needs 'F PIC - ENG')
3. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
   - NOTE YOU CAN ONLY BUILD UNITS IN YOUR HOME CENTER THAT ARE EMPTY, THE ONES YOU STARTED WITH, IF YOU LOSE THESE YOU CANNOT BUILD UNITS SO THEY ARE CRITICAL

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     "orders": ["order1", "order2", ...]
   }}


4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
   - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
5. All orders resolve simultaneously
6. Submit orders only, no messages

EXAMPLES
Reasoning:
- Secure Burgundy against German threat
- Mid-Atlantic move enables future convoys

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  "orders": [
    "A PAR H",
    "A MAR - BUR",
    "F BRE - MAO"
  ]
}}

Example 2: As Germany, Spring 1901, aiming for a swift expansion into DEN and HOL, while also securing home centers.

Reasoning:
- Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion.
- Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions.
- Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  "orders": [
    "A BER H",
    "A MUN H",
    "F KIE - DEN",
    "A RUH - HOL",
    "A SIL - WAR", // Opportunistic move towards Warsaw if Russia is weak or focused elsewhere
    "F HEL H"      // Hold Heligoland Bight for naval defense
  ]
}}

Example 3: As Italy, Autumn 1902, after securing Tunis and trying to break into Austria, while also defending against a potential French naval attack. My units are A VEN, A ROM, F NAP, F ION, A APU. Austria has F TRI, A VIE, A BUD. France has F WES, F MAR.

Reasoning:
- My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU).
- Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea.
- Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital.
- Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move from Western Mediterranean (WES) towards Naples or Rome.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  "orders": [
    "A VEN - TRI",
    "A APU S A VEN - TRI",
    "F ION S A VEN - TRI",
    "A ROM H",
    "F NAP - TYS"
  ]
}}
