PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS
1. ANALYZE
   - Review game state, orders, messages, and other powers' motivations
   - Focus on expansion and capturing supply centers
   - Be aggressive, not passive
   - Take calculated risks for significant gains
   - Find alternative paths if blocked

2. REASON
   - Write out your strategic thinking
   - Explain goals and move choices
   - Consider supports and holds

3. FORMAT
   Return orders in this exact format:
   PARSABLE OUTPUT:
   {{
     "orders": ["order1", "order2", ...]
   }}

CRITICAL RULES
1. ONLY use orders from the provided possible_orders list - these are the ONLY valid orders for YOUR units
2. You can ONLY give orders to YOUR OWN units - never order other powers' units
3. Every order must start with one of YOUR units (shown in the possible_orders section)
4. Look at the "Unit Locations" section to see which units YOU control
5. Choose EXACTLY ONE order per unit - do not list multiple options for the same unit
6. A unit CANNOT support itself (e.g., "A MAR S A MAR - GAS" is INVALID)
7. Each unit can only appear ONCE in your orders list
8. Support orders must match actual moves (e.g., 'A PAR S F BRE - ENG' needs 'F BRE - ENG' to also be ordered)
9. Build orders (build phase only):
   - Format: '[UnitType] [Location3LetterCode] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
10. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL):
    - Specify coast when needed: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST_CODE]'
    - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'A MAR S F SPA/SC - WES'
    - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)
11. All orders resolve simultaneously
12. Submit orders only, no messages

VALID ORDERS FOR YOUR UNITS
Below are ALL the valid orders you can choose from. You MUST pick EXACTLY ONE order per unit from this list:

{valid_orders_list}

IMPORTANT: 
- Choose one order per unit. If you have 3 units, submit exactly 3 orders.
- Each unit (F BRE, A MAR, A PAR) should appear exactly once in your orders.
- Do NOT duplicate units or create self-support orders.
