gemma3:latest,FRANCE,S1901M,order_generation,"Reasoning:
My primary objective is to rapidly expand control of supply centers, prioritizing those within reach of my existing forces. Given my current position and the available orders, I will focus on securing Burgundy (F PIC - ENG) and then move to take Trieste (A VEN - TRI).  I'll use the fleet to provide naval support during this aggressive expansion. I'll also reinforce my existing holdings to deter any opportunistic attacks.

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
