gemma3:latest,FRANCE,S1901M,order_generation,"Reasoning:
My primary objective is to rapidly gain control of supply centers. Given the current situation, I will focus on aggressively exploiting opportunities in Scandinavia and the Low Countries. Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are undefended and present significant opportunities for expansion. Simultaneously, I’ll secure a foothold in the Low Countries to prepare for further operations in France.

ORDER SUBMISSION PROCESS:
1. ANALYZE: The situation presents a relatively open landscape in Scandinavia and the Low Countries. Germany is focused on expansion elsewhere. France’s fleet presence in the Western Mediterranean limits immediate naval pressure.
2. REASON: Securing DEN and HOL offers immediate supply centers and strategic positions for future operations.  Moving into the Low Countries enables potential access to France later.
