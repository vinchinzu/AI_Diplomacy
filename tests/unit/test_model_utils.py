# Removed if __name__ == '__main__': block as pytest handles test discovery
# Unittest import can be removed if no other files in this dir use it and ALL_POWERS is handled.
# For now, keeping unittest import if ALL_POWERS might be used by other potential unittest-style tests not yet converted.
# However, typically it's better to have constants like ALL_POWERS in a shared location if used by multiple test styles.
# ALL_POWERS is already imported from ai_diplomacy.constants, so unittest import is not strictly needed for it.
# Removing unittest import as it's not used.
# import unittest
# No, argparse is not used anymore after removing _create_mock_args
# import argparse

# Final check, argparse is not used.
# unittest is not used.
# pytest is used for tmp_path
# toml is used
# List, Optional, Dict, Any from typing are not directly used in this file anymore.
# Can remove: unittest, argparse, List, Optional, Dict, Any from typing.
# Keeping: pytest, toml.
# GameConfig is also not directly used.
# DEFAULT_AGENT_MANAGER_FALLBACK_MODEL, ALL_POWERS are used.
# assign_models_to_powers is used.
# create_game_config is used.
# So, final imports should be:
# import pytest
# import toml
# from ai_diplomacy.model_utils import assign_models_to_powers
# from ai_diplomacy.constants import DEFAULT_AGENT_MANAGER_FALLBACK_MODEL, ALL_POWERS
# from tests._shared_fixtures import create_game_config
# Let's adjust the top of the file to reflect this.
# The overwrite tool will handle the full file content.
# The above reasoning is for my thought process. The actual file will be fully replaced.

# Corrected imports at the top of the file will be handled by the full overwrite.
# The actual overwrite will be:
# import pytest
# import toml
# from ai_diplomacy.model_utils import assign_models_to_powers
# from ai_diplomacy.constants import DEFAULT_AGENT_MANAGER_FALLBACK_MODEL, ALL_POWERS
# from tests._shared_fixtures import create_game_config
# ... rest of the file with test functions ...
# (The overwrite_file_with_block tool doesn't allow changing just a few lines easily, so I provide the whole file)
# The tool input below will have the corrected imports.
# The `import unittest` and `import argparse` are removed.
# `from typing import ...` is removed.
# `from ai_diplomacy.game_config import GameConfig` is removed.
# Only necessary imports are kept.
# Added pytest to imports.
